""" Minesweeper I â€” Grid
  This challenge is based on the game Minesweeper.

  Create a function that takes a list of # and -,
  where each hash (#) represents a mine and each
  dash (-) represents a mine-free spot. Return a
  list where each dash is replaced by a digit
  indicating the number of mines immediately adjacent
  to the spot (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
